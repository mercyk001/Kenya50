# Kenya 50 Card Game

## Description
The Kenya 50 Card Game is a Single Page Application (SPA) built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application simulates a card game where users can draw cards representing different animals, each with unique attributes such as name, description, points, and category. The game communicates with a local JSON server to fetch the card data.


## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the SPA.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the application.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the application's interactivity and API integration.
- `db.json`: The JSON file containing the card data used by the JSON server.

## Features
- **Single Page Application**: The entire app runs on a single page with no redirects or reloads.
- **Interactive Cards**: Users can draw random cards with unique attributes.
- **Event Listeners**: The application incorporates multiple event listeners for user interactions.
- **Asynchronous Data Fetching**: All interactions between the client and the API are handled asynchronously using JSON as the communication format.
